Introduction

Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB built a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

By the end of this project, good understanding of how the MERN Stack works was built.


Setup:

run npm i && npm start for both client and server side to start the app
